            <h1>About This Assignment</h1>
            <h2>Special Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Creating a nav bar to allow user to access different webpages conveniently
                </li>
                <li>
                    Having placeholders to make it clearer to the user what to input
                </li>
                <li>
                    I have attempted and managed to create using PHP where the user stays on the same page in the post status page, and the values they have inputted in is still there when any requirement has not been met. This is so that the user does not have to input everything back in again and it allows the user to change the parts that does not meet the requirements. However as I moved on to task 3, I realized my PHP code has to be on a different page and could not create the same special features.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I have also attempted and create a reset button but it only works when my PHP code is in the same file as the poststatusform.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Struggles</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Struggled with the reset button and getting it to work without submitting the form. Then realized the assignment does not actually require a reset button.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Struggled with getting the query right for the search process. Turns out I need to string concatenate the value of user input with the rest of the query for it to work.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Things to do better next time</h2>
