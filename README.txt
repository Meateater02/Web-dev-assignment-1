A posting system is required to be built for this project. 

The user is to fill in a form with fields which are required, except for radio buttons and checkbox types. The form will then be posted into a 
database using php and mySQL.

PHP is required to check the user's input for certain requirements to be met before it is posted into the database. 

In another html page, the user is allowed to search up the database with keywords that match the status column. An appropriate message or result 
will then be returned back to the user. If the search succeed in one or more results, all information (status, status code, share, dataposted, 
and permission) are to be shown to the user. 

An About page is required with answers in bullet points on what I have learnt in this project, what I could do better next time and so on.
